# Abstract

To not repeat myself in the write-ups, please refer to the [info page](/wetlands/info) of the project for the introduction, methods, and materials.

## Analysis

### Big Pond

### Small Pond

## Conclusions

The pH levels are stable in both ponds but it's hard to say if the levels are stable since these are once a week data point, at almost the same time, collections not 24/7 sensor collection.

## Other Notes

I realized my mistake on how I formatted the date data and fixed into week number, yy instead of mm,dd,yy. I used LibreOffice Calc to convert the date into week number based on the year and concatenating the year to 20yy, as I only had it in the two digit format. Function used: ```=WEEKNUM(DATE(CONCATENATE(20,D2),A2,B2))```

###What I Learned

####During the Data Collection Seasons

The final data collection season ended on the last week of October of 2018 and I learned  that using peat moss does not allow growth of native plants. If I had an extra season or two, the next step of the experiment would of been to plant the yarrow and comfrey in the fall before and winter them for 2019.

####Open Science

The reason why chose to do this project is I have the permission to upload the data and my work to the public domain. In return, I learned how to structure the [repo](https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands) on GitHub and here, how format a .csv file, and what organizations are doing wetlands work in the realm of Open Science.

I'm still working on this project, mostly data processing and research, and I will add my findings under the year that I did the work in.
