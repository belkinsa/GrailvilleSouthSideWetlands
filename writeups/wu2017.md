# Abstract

To not repeat myself in the write-ups, please refer to the [info page](/wetlands/info) of the project for the introduction, methods, and materials.

# Analysis

## Big Pond

So far this year, the pH started at 8 with a few times going down to 7.5 but in most of May and the first week of June. After that first week of June, the pH stayed stable with some fluctuations between 6 and 7.5.

I decided to focus on analyzing pH out of all the elements because it's the one that changes the most. The average pH over the years rose while the min went down and the max stayed the same.

There was only two ammonia level spikes but they didn't raise above 0.25.

Like last year, the nitrite and phosphate levels stayed down at 0 ppm.

## Small Pond

So far for this year, the pH has mostly stayed between 6.5 and 7.5, only one time reaching to 8; that was when the data collection season started.

I decided to focus on analyzing pH out of all the elements because it's the one that changes the most. The average pH over the years rose while the min and max changed through the years.

The ammonia levels were high in the start of the data collection season going from 0.25 ppm to 1 ppm then going down to 0, then again from 0.5 to 0. Until August, the levels stayed at 0, and at two moments rose to 0.25.

Only once, in June, the nitrite levels rose to 0.25 ppm but they quickly came down.

Like last year, the phosphate levels stayed down at 0 ppm.

# Conclusions

## Both Ponds

While I'm aware that the number of sample per year don't match, I still think the pH is slowly raising but not to a dangerous level as this graphic shows:

Once again, I think there might be a correlation with weather because it rained those days/weeks (before or that week) where there were spikes.

## Big Pond

Nothing can be said about the big pond, I think it's stable even though there is duckweed in the pond.

## Small Pond

Like the small pond, I think it's stable even though there is duckweed in the pond.

# Other Notes

##What I Learned

I did research on who within the USA Government does wetlands work and how they classify the two ponds.

### USA Government Services

- There is [National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)](https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/index.html) which keeps a inventory of the wetlands in the USA and classifies them.

- [USDA Natural Resources Consevrvation Service](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/site/national/home/) has a [National Wetland Plant List (NWPL)](http://wetland_plants.usace.army.mil/)

### Grailville

- Based on the NWI both ponds are classified as a PUBgh (**1**) and is a freshwater pond but the little is 1.33 arces and the big is 1.53 arces. There is also a freshwater emegrent wetland that is a PEM1Ch (**2**), 0.90 arce wetland.

Both wetlands are natural wetlands, not constructed, and therefore, the first question of my research is removed from the list. I don't see it being a useful point to research or talk about.

#### Footnotes

**1,2**- [Ref Page](http://128.104.224.198/wetlands.aspx)

**1**

>**P** 	System **PALUSTRINE**: The Palustrine System includes all nontidal wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs, persistent emergents, emergent mosses or lichens, and all such wetlands that occur in tidal areas where salinity due to ocean-derived salts is below 0.5 ppt. It also includes wetlands lacking such vegetation, but with all of the following four characteristics: (1) area less than 8 ha (20 acres); (2) active wave-formed or bedrock shoreline features lacking; (3) water depth in the deepest part of basin less than 2.5 m (8.2 ft) at low water; and (4) salinity due to ocean-derived salts less than 0.5 ppt.

>**UB** 	Class **UNCONSOLIDATED BOTTOM**: Includes all wetlands and deepwater habitats with at least 25% cover of particles smaller than stones (less than 6-7 cm), and a vegetative cover less than 30%.

>**G** 	Water Regime **Intermittently Exposed**: Water covers the substrate throughout the year except in years of extreme drought.

>Other Modifier(s):

>**h** 	SPECIAL MODIFIER **Diked/Impounded**: These wetlands have been created or modified by a man-made barrier or dam that obstructs the inflow or outflow of water.

**2**

See code for **P** above.

>**EM** 	Class **EMERGENT**: Characterized by erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes, excluding mosses and lichens. This vegetation is present for most of the growing season in most years. These wetlands are usually dominated by perennial plants.

>**1** 	Subclass **Persistent**: Dominated by species that normally remain standing at least until the beginning of the next growing season. This subclass is found only in the Estuarine and Palustrine systems.

>Other Modifier(s):

>**C** 	WATER REGIME **Seasonally Flooded**: Surface water is present for extended periods especially early in the growing season, but is absent by the end of the growing season in most years. The water table after flooding ceases is variable, extending from saturated to the surface to a water table well below the ground surface.
