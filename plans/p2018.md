# Fish

N/A

# Plants

One possible experiment could be having the small rafts just have pots with soil and fiber and allow the aquatic plants to live for a season.

# Duckweed

Try to find the source of the pollution rather than removing the duckweed. **Rationale:** Duckweed thrives on unhealthy ponds.

# Pond Aeration

Try to remove the aerator from the big pond and place it in the small pond. **Rationale:** As said above, a possible source of pollution is the lack of dissolved oxygen.

**03/01/18:** Found out that the aerator is broken, nothing can be done.

# Muck

Use nibblers like in 2016 and 2017.

# Equipment Needed

- Kayak
- Rafts
- Nibblers
