# Fish

Just a suggestion at this time:

A combination of koi and grass carp should work.  The koi can go at the duckweed while the carp can go at the other things in the pond.

# Plants

Mary Lu will start the plants in pots before they will be placed in the ponds, these are:

- Daylilies
- ???
- ???
- ???

And try to get them in the middle of the pond.

# Duckweed

Try to do the same like in 2016.

# Muck

Use nibbers like in 2016.

# Equipment Needed

- Kayak
- Pond aerator (need to be found)
- Net
- Nibers
