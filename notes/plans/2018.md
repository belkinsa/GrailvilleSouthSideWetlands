N/A

# Plants

One possible expriment could be having the small rafts just have pots with soil and firbe and allow the aquatic plants to live for a season.

# Duckweed

Try to find the source of the pollution rather than removing the duckweed. **Rationale:** Duckweed thrives on unheathly ponds.

# Muck

Use nibbers like in 2016 and 2017.

# Equipment Needed

- Kayak
- Nibers
