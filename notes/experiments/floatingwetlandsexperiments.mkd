#2018 Data Collection Season

##Introduction

In the last data collection season (2017), three floats were placed with yarrow and comfrey but at the end of the season aquatic plants possibly from seeds that were carried from the local wildlife out competed the yarrow and comfrey.  Due to this, this seasons floating wetlands experiment will focus on the effects of aquatic plants that were grown from seeds from wildlife.

##Materials

- One small mat
- Pots
- Organic potting soil
- Organic cleaning solution
- Organic Fiber
- Kayak
- Rope
- Brick

##Method

1. Clean the mat and the pots with organic cleaning solution. This is done to make sure that there are no residual seeds that may of survived.

**Note**: These steps below should be done after Mother's Day in the Midwest due to frost.

2. Place organic fiber in the pots along the outside edges of the inside making sure the bottom is covered. Then place organic potting soil in the fiber.
3. Once at pond, place the pots into the holes of the mat.
4. Tie some rope to one end of the mat with a brick. This brick acts as the weight to keep the mat from drifting off. Tie another length of  rope either on the same side as the rope for the brick or another side. The other end of the rope will be tied to a pole or a tree branch.  Again, this prevents the mat from drifting and it also allows easy removal at the end of the season.
5. Take the kayak and take the mat out into the pond.
6. Data collect like normal.
7. At the end of the data collection season (around the last week of October), use the rope that was tied to a pole or a branch to pull in the mat.
