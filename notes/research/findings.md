## Wetlands

### USA Government Services

- There is [National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)](https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/index.html) which keeps a inventory of the wetlands in the USA and classifies them.

- [USDA Natural Resources Consevrvation Service](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/site/national/home/) has a [National Wetland Plant List (NWPL)](http://wetland_plants.usace.army.mil/)

## Grailville

- Based on the NWI both ponds are classified as a PUBgh (**1**) and is a freshwater pond but the little is 1.33 arces and the big is 1.53 arces. There is also a freshwater emegrent wetland that is a PEM1Ch (**2**), 0.90 arce wetland.

**1**

>**P** 	System **PALUSTRINE**: The Palustrine System includes all nontidal wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs, persistent emergents, emergent mosses or lichens, and all such wetlands that occur in tidal areas where salinity due to ocean-derived salts is below 0.5 ppt. It also includes wetlands lacking such vegetation, but with all of the following four characteristics: (1) area less than 8 ha (20 acres); (2) active wave-formed or bedrock shoreline features lacking; (3) water depth in the deepest part of basin less than 2.5 m (8.2 ft) at low water; and (4) salinity due to ocean-derived salts less than 0.5 ppt.

>**UB** 	Class **UNCONSOLIDATED BOTTOM**: Includes all wetlands and deepwater habitats with at least 25% cover of particles smaller than stones (less than 6-7 cm), and a vegetative cover less than 30%.

>**G** 	Water Regime **Intermittently Exposed**: Water covers the substrate throughout the year except in years of extreme drought.

>Other Modifier(s):

>**h** 	SPECIAL MODIFIER **Diked/Impounded**: These wetlands have been created or modified by a man-made barrier or dam that obstructs the inflow or outflow of water.

See code for **P** above.

>**EM** 	Class **EMERGENT**: Characterized by erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes, excluding mosses and lichens. This vegetation is present for most of the growing season in most years. These wetlands are usually dominated by perennial plants.

>**1** 	Subclass **Persistent**: Dominated by species that normally remain standing at least until the beginning of the next growing season. This subclass is found only in the Estuarine and Palustrine systems.

>Other Modifier(s):

>**C** 	WATER REGIME **Seasonally Flooded**: Surface water is present for extended periods especially early in the growing season, but is absent by the end of the growing season in most years. The water table after flooding ceases is variable, extending from saturated to the surface to a water table well below the ground surface.
