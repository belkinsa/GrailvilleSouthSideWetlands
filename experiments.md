# 2018 Data Collection Season

## Introduction

In the last data collection season (2017), three floats were placed with yarrow and comfrey but at the end of the season aquatic plants possibly from seeds that were carried from the local wildlife out competed the yarrow and comfrey.  Due to this, this seasons floating wetlands experiment will focus on the effects of aquatic plants that were grown from seeds from wildlife.

## Materials

- One small mat
- Pots
- Organic cleaning solution, example: baking soda and vinegar, Ecover
- Organic Coconut Coir or peat moss
- Kayak
- Rope
- Brick

## Method

**Note:** This step should be done at least two days when it's a sunny day before placing the mats with the pots in the pond as the mats and the pots need to dry in the sun.

1. Clean the mat and the pots with organic cleaning solution. Ecover was used in this experiment. This is done to make sure that there are no residual seeds that may of survived.
2. Dry the mat and pots in the sun.

**Note**: These steps below should be done after Mother's Day in the Midwest due to frost.

2. Both peat moss and Coconut Coir, which comes in a brick, need to be moistened. To do so, place the material in a deep bowl and place  some water and mix. You will need a packing consistency in order to pack the pots to the top. If too dry, the peat moss/coir will flow out of the pot, mainly the top.  If too wet, it might not pack well.
3. Once at pond, place the pots into the holes of the mat.
4. Tie some rope to one end of the mat with a brick. This brick acts as the weight to keep the mat from drifting off.
5. Take the kayak and take the mat out into the pond.
6. Data collect like normal.
7. At the end of the data collection season (around the last week of October), use the kayak to pull in the mat.
