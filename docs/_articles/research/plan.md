# Research Plan

## 2017

### Steps

1. Research on **what** first...
2. ...**why** next...
3. ...then **who**...
4. ...and last but not least **how**.

Okay, I was having fun when I wrote this on paper and couldn't resist on not keeping it!

**In translation...**

Understanding **what** first will allow me to understand **why** then **who** and last but not least **how** to make impact within/for wetlands.

The point is I feel that, from my very basic understanding of what a wetland is, I'm not getting anywhere near creating solutions for maintaining a pond organically.

### What I know already

1. **What** are wetlands?
   - Natural
   - Constructed
2. (**What**)It's a habitat (Midwest, Ohio, Southwestern Ohio)
3. (**How**)Monitoring through:
    - Chemical
    - Data loggers
    - [Mapping kits](https://publiclab.org/)
4. (**Who**)[Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/), EPA
5. (**Who,What**)[Urban Rivers](http://urbanriv.org/) and their floats and system
6. (**What**)Basic Chemistry

### What I want know (in the same order as above)

1. (**What**)Differences between the two types of wetlands
2. (**What**)Keystone and interactions
3. (**How, Why**)Impact that other than to keep water clean and livable
4. (**Who**)Any wetlands only groups/orgs
5. (**Who,How**)Would their idea worth to use in wetlands
6. (**What,Why**)More in depth and why it works when it's works
