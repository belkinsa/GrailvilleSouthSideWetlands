# Graillville Wetlands Project

## Introduction

### Wetland

From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland):

>A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants,adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life.

#### Constructed Wetland

From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_wetland):

>A constructed wetland (CW) is an artificial wetland created for the purpose of treating anthropogenic discharge such as municipal or industrial wastewater, or stormwater runoff. It may also be created for land reclamation after mining, refineries, or other ecological disturbances such as required mitigation for natural areas lost to land development.

The Grailville ponds are an examples of constructed wetlands, mainly the small/little pond.

### Grailville

From the main page of [Grailville](http://www.grailville.org/):

>Grailville is owned by [The Grail](http://www.grail-us.org/), an international movement of women, called by our spiritual values, envisioning a world of peace, justice and renewal of the earth, brought about by women working together as catalysts for change. Grailville—a rural oasis just a short drive from Cincinnati—is a tangible expression of the Grail’s mission and values. A center of education, leadership, peace and care of the earth since 1944, Grailville continues to be a sacred space for women and men of all ages seeking a community of shared values.

#### The Wetlands Project

From the [initiatives](http://www.grailville.org/green-grailville/initiatives/) page:

> Our floating wetlands in the “little” pond were designed to help it come back to life, using a natural method—following the same science behind Grailville’s Constructed Wetlands—to clear up the water. The plants grow root systems which float in the pond and act as filters and use conversion to help reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus levels and replenish the water with oxygen. Each spring volunteers prepare and install the wetlands which are then removed and “wintered” in October.

## Materials

* An [API Pond Care Pond Master Test Kit](http://www.apifishcare.com/product.php?sectionid=2&catid=22&subcatid=110&id=670#.WNl4wEe1ukA)
* Cups for sample collection
* Metal stick with a cup holder on one end for sample collection help
* LibreOffice Calc for data analysis
* Text Editor (gedit) for data collection in .csv format
* R will be used later

## Methods

### During the data collection season (late March to late October)

1. Once a week samples are collected from the two ponds (big and small). The metal stick and one cup for each pond are used to collect a cup full of pond water for sample collection.

2. Those samples are than analyzed using a simple pond testing kit to analyze the levels of pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, and Phosphate.

3. A .csv file for each pond is used to collect data, labeled [big.csv](https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/dataanalysis/data/big.csv) and [small.csv](https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/dataanalysis/data/small.csv) respectfully.

4. That data gets uploaded to this repo and [notes](https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/notes/timeline.md), if any.

### During the off season

1. Data analysis occurs, mainly looking for correlation of data deviation from 7 pH and zero (0) ppm respectfully of the values measured and weather changes, mostly when it rains..

2. Pre- and post season write-up is written.
