# Graillville Wetlands Project

## What is it?

### Grailville

From the main page of [Grailville](http://www.grailville.org/):

>Grailville is owned by The Grail, an international movement of women, called by our spiritual values, envisioning a world of peace, justice and renewal of the earth, brought about by women working together as catalysts for change. Grailville—a rural oasis just a short drive from Cincinnati—is a tangible expression of the Grail’s mission and values. A center of education, leadership, peace and care of the earth since 1944, Grailville continues to be a sacred space for women and men of all ages seeking a community of shared values.

### The Wetlands Project

From the [initiatives](http://www.grailville.org/green-grailville/initiatives/) page:

> Our floating wetlands in the “little” pond were designed to help it come back to life, using a natural method—following the same science behind Grailville’s Constructed Wetlands—to clear up the water. The plants grow root systems which float in the pond and act as filters and use conversion to help reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus levels and replenish the water with oxygen. Each spring volunteers prepare and install the wetlands which are then removed and “wintered” in October.
