# 2018 Write-Up

## Abstract

To not repeat myself in the write-ups, please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/README.md) of the repo for the introduction, methods, and materials.

## Analysis

### Big Pond

### Small Pond

## Conclusions

The pH levels are stable in both ponds but it's hard to say if the levels are stable since these are once a week data point, at almost the same time, collections not 24/7 sensor collection.

### Other Notes

I realized my mistake on how I formatted the date data and fixed into week number, yy instead of mm,dd,yy. I used LibreOffice Calc to convert the date into week number based on the year and concatenating the year to 20yy, as I only had it in the two digit format. Function used: ```=WEEKNUM(DATE(CONCATENATE(20,D2),A2,B2))```
