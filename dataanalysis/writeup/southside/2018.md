### Other Notes

I realized my mistake on how I formatted the date data and fixed into week number, yy instead of mm,dd,yy. I used LibreOffice Calc to convert the date into week number based on the year and concatenating the year to 20yy, as I only had it in the two digit format. Function used: =WEEKNUM(DATE(CONCATENATE(20,D2),A2,B2))
