# 2017 Write-Up

## Abstract

To not repeat myself in the write-ups, please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/belkinsa/GrailvilleWetlands/blob/master/README.md) of the repo for the introduction, methods, and materials.

## Analysis

### Big Pond

So far this year, the pH started at 8 with a few times going down to 7.5 but in most of May and the first week of June. After that first week of June, the pH stayed stable with some fluxuations between 6 and 7.5.

I decided to focus on analyzing pH out of all the elements because it's the one that changes the most. The average pH over the years rose while the min went down and the max stayed the same.

There was only two ammonia level spikes but they didn't raise above 0.25.

Like last year, the nitrite and phosphate levels stayed down at 0 ppm.

### Small Pond

So far for this year, the pH has mostly stayed between 6.5 and 7.5, only one time reaching to 8; that was when the data collection season started.

I decided to focus on analyzing pH out of all the elements because it's the one that changes the most. The average pH over the years rose while the min and max changed through the years.

The ammonia levels were high in the start of the data collection season going from 0.25 ppm to 1 ppm then going down to 0, then again from 0.5 to 0. Until August, the levels stayed at 0, and at two moments rose to 0.25.

Only once, in June, the nitrite levels rose to 0.25 ppm but they quickly came down.

Like last year, the phosphate levels stayed down at 0 ppm.

## Conclusions

### Both Ponds

While I'm aware that the number of sample per year don't match, I still think the pH is slowly raising but not to a dangous level as this grahpic shows:

Once again, I think there might be a correlation with weather because it rained those days/weeks (before or that week) where there were spikes.

### Big Pond

Nothing can be said about the big pond, I think it's stable even though there is duckweed in the pond.

### Small Pond

Like the small pond, I think it's stable even though there is duckweed in the pond.
